#### Technical Improvements 💪 
- Worked with crucial package functions:
  - Introduced `SensitiveCHecker` Class
  - Introduced various other classes to include OOPS concepts `FileReader` ,`ContentAnalyzer` , `PatternLoader` 
  - Inside each class , introduced methods to handle the file operations, content analysis, pattern matching, etc.
