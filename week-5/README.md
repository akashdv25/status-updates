![](sip.png)

#### What is SIP? 📞
**Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)** is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time communications including:
- Voice calls
- Video conferences
- Instant messaging
- Media distribution

#### Understanding SIP Trunking 🌐
SIP Trunking is a virtual connection between your organization and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) using the internet. Think of it as a virtual phone line that:
- Replaces traditional physical phone lines
- Enables voice calls over IP networks
- Connects your voice system directly to the PSTN

2. **Call Flow**
   - Converts voice to data packets
   - Transmits over IP network
   - Reconverts to voice at destination

#### Benefits Implemented 🌟
1. **Cost Efficiency** 💰
   - Reduced per-call costs
   - Bulk calling capabilities
   - Optimized resource utilization

2. **Enhanced Performance** ⚡
   - Lower latency
